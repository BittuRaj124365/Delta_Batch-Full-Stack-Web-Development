    There will be no difference between header tag and normal paragraph, but by using semantic tags, codee becomes undestandable and meaningful just by looking on it.
   Note:- Usually, these types of semantic tags that are used below are used once for a single website.
   
   Four semantic tag, we have used in this program as examples are header,footer,main and nav(navigation) tag.
 ----!Navigation(nav tag):- nav tag is used to ad another section in the page in which we can add link for another websites or pages.And, generally, nav tag is used within header tag or you can use outside from the header tag too.
