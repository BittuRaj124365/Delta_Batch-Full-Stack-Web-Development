  ->  Entities:- An HTML entity is a piece of text(string) that begins with an ampersand(&) and ends with a semocolon(;).
  -> used to display reserved characters(which would otherwise be interpreted(prohibited) as HTML code), and invisible characters(like non-breaking spaces).
  -> can also use in place of characters that are difficult to type with a standard keyboard.
  -> browser interprets them and renders correct character.
